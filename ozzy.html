                        <p class="card-text">One of the pioneers of heavy metal and one of its most commercially
                            successful and iconic artists, Ozzy Osbourne was born in Birmingham, England, as John
                            Michael Osbourne. After leaving school and having many odd jobs, he ended up in a band with
                            Geezer Butler. This group then split, leading Ozzy and Geezer to join Tony Iommi and Bill
                            Ward in a new band that went under several names (including Earth) that ended up being
                            called Black Sabbath after a song of the same name that appeared on their first album
                            (released 1969/70). He recorded several more albums with Sabbath despite the decline of his
                            relationship with Tony Iommi, which after several break ups led to him leaving/being fired
                            from the band in 1979. After a short time he launched a solo career with a line up behind
                            him that varied immensely from album to album and tour to tour. During the 80's he was
                            treated several times for alcoholism and was sued twice for the suicides of some of his
                            young fans (cleared completely). Following his No More Tears album he declared he would tour
                            for the last time. In 1991, on his last date he reformed briefly on stage with Black Sabbath
                            for three songs. However a much talked about reformation tour fell through and Ozzy seemed
                            to go into retirement, his bassist (Mike Inez) joined Alice in Chains and the guitarist
                            (Zakk Wylde) formed his own band, Pride and Glory. Now however he is recording a new album
                            and has said he intends to tour again. The album should be out in the summer of 1995 and the
                            tour should be shortly after. Geezer Butler has now quit Sabbath (again) and rejoined Ozzy
                            (he played bass for him on tour during the mid to late 80's) and should play on the new
                            album.</p>
