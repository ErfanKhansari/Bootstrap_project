                            <p class="card-text text-light">One of the most renowned songwriters as well as an English singer is Robert
                                Halford. He is most renowned as the lead vocalist for the heavy metal band called Judas
                                Priest, which has won Grammy awards. He is a remarkable singer, and his voice has a great
                                impact on the music industry.
    
                                Born on August 25, 1951, in Birmingham, England, Halford began singing as a teenager,
                                fronting a local rock band, Hiroshima, and working as a theatrical lighting engineer. His
                                black-leather outfits gave the genre its trademark look, his pitch-perfect vocals gave it
                                some drama, and his penchant for riding motorcycles onstage gave it some larger-than-life
                                flair.
    
                                He recalls several occasions where he would sing anthems like “Breaking the Law” and “Living
                                After Midnight” to 10s of thousands of screaming “headbanging metal maniacs,” only to
                                struggle backstage with denying his true self by hiding his sexuality. His language is vivid
                                and personal — often lapsing into a working-class British dialect he calls “yam-yam” — and
                                his tale is compelling.</p>
